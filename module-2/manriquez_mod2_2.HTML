        <h2>Chapter 1 : The Luna Butterfly</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Romany Manriquez, and I go by the name The Luna Butterfly as my artist name. I've loved creating since I was in kindergarten and have always been driven by my passions for creating. Art has been my way of expressing myself.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in South Texas, I am the daughter of great migrant workers who moved here from Mexico to give my four sisters and I a better life. Growing up in a tight-knit community taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. My parents' sacrifices have always inspired me to strive for excellence.</p>
        <p>Being the middle child, I always looked up to my two older sisters who set great examples for me. They taught me the importance of kindness, determination, and resilience. I've always felt a sense of responsibility to be a role model for my younger sisters, guiding them with the same love and support I received.</p>
        <p>My goal is to succeed in this new chapter in my life, becoming a software engineer and creating new things that can help this amazing world. What I want most is to make my family proud. I believe that by following my passions and staying true to myself, I can make a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
